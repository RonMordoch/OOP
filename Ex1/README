Book.java - contains the methods for a book object.
Patron.java - contains the methods for a patron object.
Library.java - implements the library class, which manages a library system using
book objects and patron objects.

=============================
Library class manages the interactions between books and patrons, while
following set rules for the libray, e.g. maximum number of books allowed to be borrowed
by a single patron registered to the library.

=============================
For keeping track of bookIds and patronIds, I used arrays, one for book objects
and one for patron objects. The Ids for each book ( or patron ) are the index in which
they appear in the list.
Also, in order to keep track of how many book a patron is currently borrowing, I added
a member, a list of int, that represents the current number of books borrowed by a patron,
when their indexes are their ids, 
and 2 methods - a getter for the number and a method that adds a given amount, which is 
called in the library class with th number 1, -1 for borrowing and returning books respectively.
At first I thought of adding an int member numOfBooksBorrowed for the Patron class, but
after thinking about it properly I figured that this would cause complications when the same
patron is registered to different libraries.
